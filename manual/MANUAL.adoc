cassandra-easy-stress is a workload-centric stress tool for Apache Cassandra, written in Kotlin.
Workloads are easy to write and because they are written in code. You
have the ultimate flexibility to build whatever you want without having to learn and
operate around the restrictions of a configuration DSL. Workloads can be tweaked via command line
parameters to make them fit your environment more closely.

One of the goals of cassandra-easy-stress is to provide enough pre-designed
workloads _out of the box,_ so it’s unnecessary to code up a workload for
most use cases. For instance, it’s very common to have a key value
workload, and want to test that. cassandra-easy-stress allows you to customize a
pre-configured key-value workload, using simple parameters to modify the
workload to fit your needs. Several workloads are included, such as:

* Time Series
* Key / Value
* Materialized Views
* Collections (maps)
* Counters

The tool is flexible enough to design workloads which leverage multiple
(thousands) of tables, hitting them as needed. Statistics are
automatically captured by the Dropwizard metrics library.

== Quickstart Example

The goal of this project is to be testing common workloads (time series, key value) against a Cassandra cluster in 15 minutes or less.

=== Installation

==== Installing a Package

*Note*: Installing from packages has not been migrated since I (Jon Haddad) began maintaining my own fork.  I'll be updating this section soon.

////
The easiest way to get started is to use your favorite package manager.

The current version is {CASSANDRA_EASY_STRESS_VERSION}.

==== Deb Packages

```
$ echo "deb https://dl.bintray.com/rustyrazorblade/tlp-tools-deb weezy main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 2895100917357435
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install cassandra-easy-stress
```

==== RPM Packages

You'll need the bintray repo set up on your machine.  Create this `/etc/yum.repos.d/tlp-tools.repo`:

```
[bintraybintray-rustyrazorblade-tlp-tools-rpm]
name=bintray-rustyrazorblade-tlp-tools-rpm
baseurl=https://dl.bintray.com/rustyrazorblade/tlp-tools-rpm
gpgcheck=0
repo_gpgcheck=0
enabled=1
```

Then run the following to install:

```
$ yum install cassandra-easy-stress
```


Further information can be found on the https://bintray.com/beta/#/rustyrazorblade/tlp-tools-rpm?tab=packages[BinTray website].

==== Tarball Install


[subs="attributes"]
```
$ curl -L -O "https://dl.bintray.com/rustyrazorblade/tlp-tools-tarball/cassandra-easy-stress-{CASSANDRA_EASY_STRESS_VERSION}.tar
$ tar -xzf cassandra-easy-stress-{CASSANDRA_EASY_STRESS_VERSION}.tar
```

////

=== Building / Using the Stress Tool from Source

This is currently the only way to use the latest version of cassandra-easy-stress.  I'm working on getting the packages updated.

////
This is advisable only if you're comfortable debugging the bash scripts, gradle, and Kotlin yourself and want to be either on the bleeding edge or add a feature.  If not, that's OK, we recommend using one of the above packages instead.
////

First you'll need to clone and build the repo.  You can grab the source here and build via the included gradle script:


```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/apache/cassandra-easy-stress.git
$ cd cassandra-easy-stress
$ ./gradlew shadowJar
```

You can now run the stress tool via the `bin/cassandra-easy-stress` script.  This is not the same script you'll be running if you've installed from a package or the tarball.

You can also create a zip, tar, or deb package by doing the following:

```bash
$ ./gradlew distZip
$ ./gradlew distTar
$ ./gradlew deb
```

=== Run Your First Stress Workload

Assuming you have either a CCM cluster or are running a single node
locally, you can run this quickstart.

Either add the `bin` directory to your PATH or from within cassandra-easy-stress
run the following command to execute 10,000 queries:

```
include::examples/cassandra-easy-stress-keyvalue.txt[lines=1]
```

You'll see the output of the keyspaces and tables that are created as well as some statistical information regarding the workload:

[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
include::examples/cassandra-easy-stress-keyvalue.txt[lines=2..-1]
----

If you've made it this far, congrats!  You've run your first workload.



== Usage

You'll probably want to do a bit more than simply run a few thousand queries against a KeyValue table with default settings.  The nice part about cassandra-easy-stress is that it not only comes with a variety of workloads that you can run to test your cluster, but that it allows you to change many of the parameters.  In the quickstart example we used the `-n` flag to change the total number of operations `cassandra-easy-stress` will execute against the database.  There are many more options available, this section will cover some of them.

=== General Help

`cassandra-easy-stress` will display the help if the `cassandra-easy-stress` command is run without any arguments or if the `--help` flag is passed:

```bash
include::examples/cassandra-easy-stress-help.txt[]
```

=== Listing All Workloads

```
include::examples/list-all.txt[]
```

=== Getting information about a workload

It's possible to get (some) information about a workload by using the info command.  This area is a bit lacking at the moment.  It currently only provides the schema and default read rate.

```
include::examples/info-key-value.txt[]
```


=== Running a Customized Stress Workload

Whenever possible we try to use human friendly numbers.  Typing out `-n 1000000000` is error prone and hard to read, `-n 1B` is much easier.

.Table Human Friendly Values
|===
|Suffix|Implication|Example|Equivalent

|k|Thousand|1k|1,000
|m|Million|1m|1,000,000
|b|Billion|1b|1,000,000,000

=== Running a stress test for a given duration instead of a number of operations

You might need to run a stress test for a given duration instead of providing a number of operations, especially in case of multithreaded stress runs. This is done by providing the duration in a human readable format with the `-d` argument. The minimum duration is 1 minute.
For example, running a test for 1 hours and 30 minutes will be done as follows:

```
$ cassandra-easy-stress run KeyValue -d "1h 30m"
```

To run a test for 1 days, 3 hours and 15 minutes (why not?), run cassandra-easy-stress as follows:

```
$ cassandra-easy-stress run KeyValue -d "1d 3h 15m"
```

==== Partition Keys

A very useful feature is controlling how many partitions are read and written to for a given stress test.  Doing a billion operations across a billion partitions is going to have a much different performance profile than writing to one hundred partitions, especially when mixed with different compaction settings.  Using `-p` we can control how many partition keys a stress test will leverage.  The keys are randomly chosen at the moment.


==== Read Rate

It's possible to specify the read rate of a test as a double.  For example, if you want to use 1% reads, you'd specify `-r .01`. The sum of the read rate and delete rate must be less than or equal to 1.0.

==== Delete Rate

It's possible to specify the delete rate of a test as a double.  For example, if you want to use 1% deletes, you'd specify `--deleterate .01`. The sum of the read rate and delete rate must be less than or equal to 1.0.

==== Compaction

It's possible to change the compaction strategy used with the `--compaction flag`.  At the moment this changes the compaction strategy of every table in the test.  This will be addressed in the future to be more flexible.

The `--compaction` flag can accept a raw string along these lines:

```
--compaction "{'class':'LeveledCompactionStrategy'}"
```

Alternatively, a shortcut format exists as of version 2.0:

```
--compaction lcs
```

The following shorthand formats are available:

.Table Compaction ShortHand
|===
|Syntax | Expansion
|stcs
a|
`{'class':'SizeTieredCompactionStrategy'}`

|stcs,4,32
a|
`{'class':'SizeTieredCompactionStrategy', 'min_threshold':4, 'max_threshold':32}`

|lcs
a|
`{'class':'LeveledCompactionStrategy'}`

|lcs,160
a|
`{'class':'LeveledCompactionStrategy', 'sstable_size_in_mb':'160'}`

|lcs,160,10
a|
`{'class':'LeveledCompactionStrategy', 'sstable_size_in_mb':'160', 'fanout_size':10}`

|twcs
a|
`{'class':'TimeWindowCompactionStrategy'}`

|twcs,1,days
a|
`{'class':'TimeWindowCompactionStrategy', 'compaction_window_size':'1', 'compaction_window_unit':'DAYS'}`

|ucs
a|
`{'class':'UnifiedCompactionStrategy'}`

|ucs,L4
a|
`{'class':'UnifiedCompactionStrategy', 'scaling_parameters':'L4'}`

|ucs,L4,L10
a|
`{'class':'UnifiedCompactionStrategy', 'scaling_parameters':'L4,L10'}`

==== Compression

It's possible to change the compression options used.  At the moment this changes the compression options of every table in the test.  This will be addressed in the future to be more flexible.


==== Customizing Fields

To some extent, workloads can be customized by leveraging the `--fields`
flag. For instance, if we look at the KeyValue workload, we have a table
called `keyvalue` which has a `value` field.

To customize the data we use for this field, we provide a generator at
the command line. By default, the `value` field will use 100-200
characters of random text. What if we’re storing blobs of text instead?
Ideally we’d like to tweak this workload to be closer to our production
use case. Let’s use random sections from various books:

```
$ cassandra-easy-stress run KeyValue --field.keyvalue.value='book(20,40)`
```

Instead of using random strings of garbage, the KeyValue workload will
now use 20-40 words extracted from books.

There are other generators available, such as names, gaussian numbers,
and cities. Not every generator applies to every type. It’s up to the
workload to specify which fields can be used this way.

=== Logging

`cassandra-easy-stress` uses the https://logging.apache.org/[Log4J 2] logging framework.

You can find the default log4j config in https://github.com/apache/cassandra-easy-stress/blob/main/src/main/resources/log4j2.yaml [`conf`, window="_blank"].  This should be suitable for most use cases.

To use your own logging configuration, simply set the shell variable `CASSANDRA_EASY_STRESS_LOG4J` to the path of the new logging configuration before running `cassandra-easy-stress` to point to the config file of your choice.

For more information on how to configure Log4J 2 please see the https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html[configuration] documentation.


==== Debian Package

The Debian package installs a basic configuration file to `/etc/cassandra-easy-stress/log4j2.yaml`.


=== Exporting Metrics

cassandra-easy-stress automatically runs an HTTP server exporting metrics in Prometheus format on port 9501.

=== Capturing Client Latencies to Parquet

You can capture detailed client latency metrics to an Apache Parquet file using the `--parquet` flag followed by a path to a file or directory:

```
$ bin/cassandra-easy-stress run KeyValue -n 10000 --parquet /path/to/output.parquet
```

This writes operation metrics including operation type, success/failure status, start time, and duration to a Parquet file that can be analyzed later with data analysis tools like Pandas, Spark, or visualization tools that support the Parquet format.

If a directory is provided instead of a file, cassandra-easy-stress will automatically create an appropriately named file in that directory.

=== Workload Restrictions

The `BasicTimeSeries` workload only supports Cassandra versions 3.0 and above. This is because range deletes are used by this workload during runtime. Range deletes are only support in Cassandra versions 3.0. An exception will is thrown if this workload is used and a Cassandra version less than 3.0 is detected during runtime.

== Developer Docs

=== Building the documentation

First generate the command examples with the following shell script:

```bash
$ manual/generate_examples.sh
```

There’s a docker service to build the HTML manual:

```
$ docker-compose up docs
```

=== Writing a Custom Workload

`cassandra-easy-stress` is a work in progress.  Writing a stress workload isn't documented yet as it is still changing.
