# This workflow will build a package using Gradle and then publish it to GitHub packages when a release is created

        # The desired behavior if no files are found using the provided path.
      #Available Options:
        #warn: Output a warning but do not fail the action
        #error: Fail the action with an error message
        #ignore: Do not output any warnings or errors, the action does not fail

        #if-no-files-found: # optional, default is warn
        # Duration after which artifact will expire in days. 0 means using default retention.
        # Minimum 1 day. Maximum 90 days unless changed from the repository settings page.

        retention-days: 0 # optional
        # The level of compression for Zlib to be applied to the artifact archive. The value can range from 0 to 9: - 0: No compression - 1: Best speed - 6: Default compression (same as GNU Gzip) - 9: Best compression Higher levels will result in better compression, but will take longer to complete. For large files that are not easily compressed, a value of 0 is recommended for significantly faster uploads.

        #compression-level: # optional, default is 6
    # If true, an artifact with a matching name will be deleted before a new one is uploaded. If false, the action will fail if an artifact for the given name already exists. Does not fail if the artifact does not exist.

        overwrite: true # optional, default is false
